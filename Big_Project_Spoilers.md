# Spoilers for the big Project

## 21-11-2024
One of the spoilers that I want to announce, is the fact that yes, it will be a
game, and it will be a 3D game, heavily inspired by Watch Dogs and
**Need for Speed**. I won't reveal the name just yet, or what the game would be
like, but that is everything that you guys need to know about, for now. I'll keep
you updated. That is, if I consider updating this file every now and then.

## 11-05-2025
The initial ideas for the big project I was initially aiming for, were ultimatively
scrapped. However, that doesn't mean that I am letting this project fully go
**offline**. No, it will remain **active**, since the concept idea has been
refreshed into doing something that ***a particular company*** should have done
years ago, but didn't make yet. In for the spoilers, the map is planned to be
massive. Release date? 2069. Jokes aside, I might try and do an attempt in getting
that one **legendary car** into the game, if the licensing allows me to. If you
seemed to notice the boldness, you might get the idea in where this is going.
