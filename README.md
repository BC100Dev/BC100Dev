Online, my name is BC100Dev, or as legacy names still can preserve, BeChris 100 and
ChrisBe 090. However, my name is indeed Christoph, or just Chris. It is simpler to
call me Chris. You can call me, however you want.

## Who am I?
I am a Java and C++ developer that likes to get things to another level. Now usually, 
you would expect a Container Runtime to be either written in C, C++, Go or other
languages that access the System-level, right? Yeah, I take it to a bigger challenge,
and address the elephant in the room. Instead of just using that one language, I use
Java.

However, I always like ideas for any type of project. I get personal, when you say
that I can't do something ("or, you can't do that" flex, given by DaniDev).

Also, Java is cool, and will never die. I guess you could say that my flex would be,
"Oh, I wrote it in Java, by the way." Something similar towards "I use Arch Linux,
by the way", which is also actually true.

## What do I do?
I do Software Development for a living. As of now, I am a trainee in Germany, being
at an age of 19.

However, I like to also do Software development outside my job. Projects like
Malware, Spyware or other types of Software always intrigue me, which clearly don't
include ransomware that is still visible on my GitHub page… Yeah, I don't talk
about my bad side anymore. I like going more into the way of Security, Privacy and
Customization.

However, I like to do Software development outside my job. I like keeping things legacy,
so I'll just straight up say that projects like Malware, Spyware and other types
of malicious software always intrigue me, which clearly don't include ransomware that
I have lately deleted from my GitHub page… Yeah, I don't talk about my bad side that
much anymore. The way that I like making software nowadays is within the principle
of SPC, standing for "Security, Privacy and Customization". Security would be for
maintaing the security of projects, minimizing the risks of using external libraries
that could have vulnerabilities at any given moment, meaning that less use of other
libraries means more control over my projects. Privacy is towards the fact that I
hate Spyware Operating Systems (talking about you, Microsoft!), meaning that I am
aiming more towards Operating Systems like Linux. No, Linux is not an OS, but Distros
like Debian and Ubuntu, are OS's (I use Arch Linux btw). Customization is the way
that Linux gives you the complete control over the Customizability on how you want it
to behave and stuff.

Lately, I have shifted from Android development into Desktop development, using
IntelliJ IDEA more than Android Studio. Mainly IntelliJ Ultimate. Yes, I pay for all
products, hence they deserve respect.

However, there is still that one big project being planned. Not spoiling, though!
What I can spoil is that it might be a game, or even a story based on a set of movie
episodes AND maybe a game. I won't spoil too much. For now, I am not revealing its
name.
