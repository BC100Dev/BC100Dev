Online, my name is BC100Dev, or as legacy names still can preserve, BeChris 100 and
ChrisBe 090. However, my name is indeed Christoph, or just Chris. It is simpler to
call me Chris. You can call me, however you want.

## Who am I?
I am a C++ developer that likes to get things to another level. Now usually, you
would expect a normal project to be written with a few dependencies, right? Yeah, I
take it to the level, where I refuse to use the external dependencies because I like
the bigger challenges, and address the elephant in the room, being the time
management. Writing big projects with barely any dependencies sounds like too much
work, but for someone that likes to take time with my projects, I see this as an
absolute win.

Also, I do tend to get personal, when someone decides to challenge me. Remember
DaniDev, the one that made Karlson because someone said "he can't make a 3D game"?
Yeah, I am somewhat similar to that because challenges are a big yes for me.

While I used Java back in the days, Java will never die, but in the recent months,
Java started more boring, especially knowing that projects that take a lot of time
tend to make me go away for a certain amount of time, come back, and have no idea,
where to continue off. This is, where I prioritize C++ nowadays because I can make
the build process go the way that I want, using `cmake`.

Also, did you know that I use Arch Linux btw?

## What do I do?
I do Software Development for a living. As of now, I am a trainee in Germany, being
at an age of 20. Currently in the second year of software development apprenticeship.
For those curious about my birthdate, it would be August 9th, 2004.

However, I like to also do Software development outside my job. Projects like
Malware, Spyware and other types of Software always intrigue me. Ransomware, on the
other hand, while it's cool, I don't like the main intention of it, being stealing
money, especially that it involves Bitcoin, which is crypto, something I don't like,
nor being comfortable about it. Malware and Spyware, those are the somewhat key go-to's,
but it's not cool to make them nowadays. I like Privacy more.

Anyway, I like to do Software development outside my job. I like keeping things legacy,
so I'll just straight up say that projects like Malware, Spyware and other types
of malicious software always intrigue me. The way that I like making software nowadays
is within the principle of SPC, standing for "Security, Privacy and Customization".
Security would be for maintaing the security of projects, minimizing the risks of using
external libraries that could have vulnerabilities at any given moment, meaning that
less use of other libraries means more control over my projects. Privacy is towards the
fact that I hate Spyware Operating Systems (talking about you, Microsoft!), meaning that
I am aiming more towards Operating Systems like Linux. No, Linux is not an OS, but
Distros like Debian and Ubuntu, are OS's (I use Arch Linux btw). Customization is the way
that Linux gives you the complete control over the Customizability on how you want it
to behave and stuff.

Lately, I have shifted from Android development into Desktop development, using
IntelliJ IDEA more than Android Studio. Mainly IntelliJ Ultimate. Yes, I pay for all
products, hence they deserve respect.

As of the IDEs that I am using, I shifted from using Android Studio (Android App
Development) into Desktop development, using tools like IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate),
CLion, PyCharm and Rider (yes, I did C#, and sometimes still do). Yes, I use the
JetBrains IDEs because they are seriously better IDEs in my opinion.

However, there is still that one big project being planned. Not spoiling, though!
What I can spoil is that it might be a game, or even a story based on a set of movie
episodes AND maybe a game. I won't spoil too much. For now, I am not revealing its
name.

## Spoilers for the big Project

### 21-11-2024
One of the spoilers that I want to announce, is the fact that yes, it will be a
game, and it will be a 3D game, heavily inspired by Watch Dogs and Need for Speed.
I won't reveal the name just yet, or what the game would be like, but that is
everything that you guys need to know about, for now. I'll keep you updated. That
is, if I consider updating this file every now and then.
