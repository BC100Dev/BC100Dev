Hello. My name is Christoph (Chris) for short. I am currently known as BC100Dev, but
as some people may remember, I am also known as "BeChris 100" and "ChrisBe 090".
These two names are my legacy names, even though I am switching names on my accounts
from these legacy ones into my current. BC100Dev is short for "BeChris 100
Development".

## Who am I?
I am a C++ developer that likes to get things to a whole different level. Usually,
a project consists of several dependencies to make the development simpler. That is
not the same for me because I usually like to reinvent the wheel, even if it means
sacrificing the time for development. However, I do like challenges, so I am willing
to explore my knowledge with Java, C++, C#, Python and Golang to the absolute levels.
One of my current projects I decided to make for the community is
[AnlinxOS](https://github.com/BC100Dev/AnlinxOS), where I decided to take in some
inspiration for new components.

While I tend to use Java from time to time, Java will never die. Although I have
moved completely to C++, I refuse to let that programming language die. Yes, I am
aware that my projects take a lot of time, but I don't want to rush things out
into distribution, so that things aren't too rigged or something. I also use `cmake`
to my absolute finest way possible.

By the way... I use Arch Linux :skull:

## What do I do?
I do Software Development for a current living. Currently, I am a trainee in Germany
being at an age of 21, while also juggling a German dual-system apprenticeship (currently
in the third year). I like to get creative with projects, so if something isn't inherently
in a way that I like or want to expand, I just do what I seek for, especially in the Desktop
space. Yes, I also moved from Android app dev to Desktop application development because of
Google. Haven't heard the news yet? Then look up AOSP enshittification, Google installing 2
apps for "security" (while being installed **without user consent**), along with them
cracking down on custom ROMs and sideloading.

Even though I do Software development as a part of my apprenticeship job, I like to make
my own things outside of the job time. Malicious software also intrigue me, since I like
a part of Cybersecurity and the understanding of how a software actually runs... even
though I like `strings` and `grep` because you can fetch out literally everything without
a hassle with tools like Ghidra. Even though that software like these intrigue me, I
prefer Security and Privacy more.

One of my priorities in software development is transparency and integrity. While I
like to keep things legacy, I like to get upfront on what something really does.
Another part of my development principles is making a certain software fully customizable,
where people can customize their tools to their needs. With that, I basically make a
principle of SPIC, where each letter has its meaning. Here is a rough translation of
each principle:

- **S - Security**: Keep things up to date and fight malicious actors &amp; scammers
- **P - Privacy**: Bring people the ability to control, how their user data is handled
  (or rather, not to handle any user data because I don't want any)
- **I - Integrity**: Be upfront and transparent
- **C - Customizability**: Let people have control of how things work

Considering that I like Linux and Android rooting is also another thing, as to why
I really like to adhere to that principle. Also, fuck Microsoft and Google forcing
us into being controlled by them.
