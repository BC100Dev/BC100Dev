I'm Christoph, also known as just Chris, BeChris, or as of now, BC100Dev. I do Java App Development, along with development in C/C++ because I like those languages.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a big (privated) Project along with other small projects
- Am I a malware/spyware writer or just a Software developer..?
- :computer: Publishing codes with different tools (Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA for Java-based Applications; PyCharm Community for Python Projects; Git CLI for other type of projects).
- ðŸ¤” I am always open for new project ideas.
- ðŸ“« E-Mail me at contact@bc100dev.net (personal E-Mail is being redacted as of now)
- I don't have that much of Java knowledge, learning C/C++

Also, Java is cool, and will never die. What's my flex? "Oh, and I wrote it in Java, by the way."

  More stuff about me
</summary>

<br >

I love coding on my projects and doing stuff that probably no one ever did. In other words, I am just the way it is but in a difficult way.

#### Update
Some of you guys know, but I am no longer providing a list of me knowing programming languages because I don't regularly update my Profile page. However, this is the list of what languages I know (updated on 01-Feb-2024).

| Language    | Skill Level                  |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Java        | good (personal fav)          |
| C           | average                      |
| C++         | average - good               |
| C#          | trash                        |
| Python      | still a kid                  |
| Kotlin      | dislikes all over the place  |
| Go (Golang) | decent                       |
