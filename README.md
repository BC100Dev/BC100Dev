Online, my name is BC100Dev, or as legacy names still can preserve, BeChris 100 and
ChrisBe 090. However, my name is indeed Christoph, or just Chris. It is simpler to
call me Chris. You can call me, however you want.

## Who am I?
I am a Java developer that likes to get things to another level. Now usually, you
would expect a Container Runtime to be either written in C, C++, Go or other
languages that access the System-level, right? Yeah, I take it to a bigger challenge,
and address the elephant in the room. Instead of just using that one language, I use
Java.

However, I always like ideas for any type of project. I get personal, when you say
that I can't do something ("or, you can't do that" flex).

Also, Java is cool, and will never die. I guess you could say that my flex would be,
"Oh, I wrote it in Java, by the way." Something similar towards "I use Arch Linux,
by the way", which is also actually true.

## What do I do?
I do Software Development for a living. As of now, I am a trainee in Germany, being
at an age of 19.

However, I like to also do Software development outside my job. Projects like
Malware, Spyware or other types of Software always intrigue me, which clearly don't
include ransomware that is still visible on my GitHub pageâ€¦ Yeah, I don't talk
about my bad side anymore. I like going more into the way of Security, Privacy and
Customization.

Lately, I have shifted from Android development into Desktop development, using
IntelliJ IDEA more than Android Studio. Mainly IntelliJ Ultimate. Yes, I pay for all
products, hence they deserve respect.

However, there is still that one big project being planned. Not spoiling, though!
