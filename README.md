## Hi I'm BeChris 100 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="40px" alt="hi">

I'm BeChris, but you may call me Chris or Christoph. I do Java App Development, along with development in C/C++ because I like those languages.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a big (privated) Project along with other small projects
- Am I a virus writer or just a Software developer..?
- :computer: Publishing codes with different tools (Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA for Java-based Applications; PyCharm Community for Python Projects; Git CLI for other type of projects).
- ðŸ¤” I am always open for new project ideas.
- ðŸ“« E-Mail me at bechris.100@outlook.com
- I don't have that much of Java knowledge, learning C/C++

Also, Java is cool, and will never die. What's my flex? "Oh, and I wrote it in Java, by the way."

  More stuff about me
</summary>

<br >

I love coding on my projects and doing stuff that probably no one ever did. In other words, I am just the way it is but in a difficult way.

#### Update
I decided to remove the list of me knowing languages because I do not update the About me Profile page regularly. That is one of them. Second, I can't keep up and possibly lie about my knowledges, so there's that. If anyone is still interested in knowing, what coding languages I understand, just message me on either Instagram, Discord or Twitter. As always, I still am trying to learn C alongside with C++, and understand the stupid linker errors.
