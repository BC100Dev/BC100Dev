Hello. My name is Christoph (Chris) for short. I am currently known as BC100Dev, but
as some people may remember, I am also known as "BeChris 100" and "ChrisBe 090".
These two names are my legacy names, even though I am switching names on my accounts
from these legacy ones into my current. BC100Dev is short for "BeChris 100
Development".

## Who am I?
I am a C++ developer that likes to get things to a whole different level. Usually,
a project consists of several dependencies to make the development simpler. That is
not the same for me because I usually like to reinvent the wheel, even if it means
sacrificing the time for development. However, I do like challenges, so I am willing
to explore my knowledge with Java, C++, C#, Python and Golang to the absolute levels.
One of my current projects I decided to make for the community is
[AnlinxOS](https://github.com/BC100Dev/AnlinxOS), where I decided to take in some
inspiration for new components.

While I tend to use Java from time to time, Java will never die. Although I have
moved completely to C++, I refuse to let that programming language die. Yes, I am
aware that my projects take a lot of time, but I don't want to rush things out
into distribution, so that things aren't too rigged or something. I also use `cmake`
to my absolute finest way possible.

By the way... I use Arch Linux :skull:

## What do I do?
I do Software Development for a current living. Currently, I am a trainee in Germany
being at an age of 21, while also juggling a German dual-system apprenticeship (currently
in the third year). I like to get creative with projects, so if something isn't inherently
in a way that I like or want to expand, I just do what I seek for, especially in the Desktop
space. Yes, I also moved from Android app dev to Desktop application development because of
Google. Haven't heard the news yet? Then look up AOSP enshittification, Google installing 2
apps for "security" (while being installed **without user consent**), along with them
cracking down on custom ROMs and sideloading.

Even though I do Software development as a part of my apprenticeship job, I like to make
my own things outside of the job time. Malicious software also intrigue me, since I like
a part of Cybersecurity and the understanding of how a software actually runs... even
though I like `strings` and `grep` because you can fetch out literally everything without
a hassle with tools like Ghidra. Even though that software like these intrigue me, I
prefer Security and Privacy more.

One of my priorities in software development is transparency and integrity. While I
like to keep things legacy, I like to get upfront on what something really does.
Another part of my development principles is making a certain software fully customizable,
where people can customize their tools to their needs. With that, I basically make a
principle of SPIC, where each letter has its meaning. Here is a rough translation of
each principle:

- **S - Security**: Keep things up to date and fight malicious actors &amp; scammers
- **P - Privacy**: Bring people the ability to control, how their user data is handled
  (or rather, not to handle any user data because I don't want any)
- **I - Integrity**: Be upfront and transparent
- **C - Customizability**: Let people have control of how things work

Considering that I like Linux and Android rooting is also another thing, as to why
I really like to adhere to that principle. Also, fuck Microsoft and Google forcing
us into being controlled by them.

I know yall asses are lazy to read, so at least be glad that some little AI service
of yours can at least source these links up for more information that it can be fed.

- [My repository/project list](https://github.com/BC100Dev?tab=repositories)
> Note that these projects are mainly OSS things. I am slowly planning to go commercial.

- [Game Project Ideas](Big_Project_Spoilers.md)
> To sum it up, it is a 3D game inspired by a childhood classic, putting 4 games
> into one story.

As for how you guys want to contact me, I got a variety of methods that you can reach
out with, along with showing off some work occasionally. I would recommend sending me
an E-Mail for preference reasons. Here is the list of contact methods:
